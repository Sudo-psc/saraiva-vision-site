# Docker Architecture Patterns - Saraiva Vision Medical Website

## Core Architecture Pattern: 7-Service Medical Application

### Service Structure
```
Frontend (React/Vite + Nginx) → API (Node.js) → Database (MySQL)
       ↓                      ↓               ↓
Nginx (Reverse Proxy)    Redis (Cache)    WordPress (CMS)
       ↓                      ↓               ↓
Health Monitor      Log Aggregator     Monitoring
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Medical Compliance First**: HIPAA/LGPD compliance in all layers
2. **Security by Default**: Non-root users, security headers, encrypted communications
3. **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and alerting
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for medical regulatory compliance

## Service Configuration Patterns

### 1. Multi-Stage Build Pattern
```dockerfile
FROM base AS deps        # Dependencies only
FROM base AS builder     # Build application
FROM base AS runner      # Production runtime
```

### 2. Health Check Pattern
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=40s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/health || exit 1
```

### 3. Non-Root Security Pattern
```dockerfile
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 appgroup
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 appuser
USER appuser
```

### 4. Medical Compliance Headers Pattern
```nginx
add_header X-Medical-Application "Saraiva Vision" always;
add_header X-Compliance-Level "HIPAA/LGPD" always;
add_header X-Data-Classification "PHI" always;
```

## Network Communication Patterns

### 1. Internal Service Communication
- Services communicate via Docker network
- Service names as DNS hostnames
- Health check dependencies ensure proper startup order

### 2. Reverse Proxy Pattern
- Single entry point for all external traffic
- SSL termination at proxy level
- Route based on URL patterns (/api/, /wp-json/, /)

### 3. API Gateway Pattern
- Frontend → API proxy for backend services
- WordPress proxy for CMS functionality
- Health endpoints for monitoring

## Data Management Patterns

### 1. Database Configuration
- Medical-grade MySQL with UTF-8 support
- HIPAA compliance settings
- Performance optimization for medical workloads

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Redis for session management and query caching
- Security with password protection
- Memory optimization for medical applications

### 3. Logging Architecture
- Fluent-bit for HIPAA-compliant audit trail
- Multiple output destinations (Elasticsearch, files, alerts)
- Medical metadata classification

## Deployment Patterns

### 1. Automated Deployment
```bash
./deploy-docker.sh  # Complete deployment with health checks
```

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
```bash
./test-docker-deployment.sh  # Full test suite with medical validation
```

### 3. Environment Management
- `.env` file for configuration
- Service-specific environment variables
- Medical compliance settings

## Security Patterns

### 1. Container Security
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only filesystems where possible
- Resource limits and constraints

### 2. Network Security
- Internal Docker network isolation
- Only essential ports exposed
- SSL/TLS for all communications

### 3. Data Security
- PHI classification in logs
- Encrypted database connections
- Secure API communication

## Monitoring Patterns

### 1. Health Monitoring
- Individual service health checks
- System-wide monitoring service
- Webhook alerts for critical failures

### 2. Log Aggregation
- Centralized logging with Fluent-bit
- Real-time log analysis
- Audit trail compliance

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate tracking

## Scalability Patterns

### 1. Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless services for easy scaling
- Load balancing capabilities
- Database connection pooling

### 2. Resource Optimization
- Memory limits per service
- CPU allocation management
- Storage optimization

### 3. High Availability
- Service health monitoring
- Automatic restart capabilities
- Graceful degradation

## Compliance Patterns

### 1. HIPAA Compliance
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and authentication
- Audit trail maintenance

### 2. LGPD Compliance
- Data consent management
- Right to deletion capabilities
- Access logging and monitoring

### 3. Medical Application Standards
- Security headers implementation
- Data classification
- Regulatory compliance documentation

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Medical Applications Require Special Considerations
- Compliance requirements affect all architecture decisions
- Security must be built-in, not added later
- Audit trails are non-negotiable for medical systems

### 2. Docker Compose is Powerful for Complex Applications
- 7-service architecture is manageable with proper configuration
- Health checks are critical for service dependencies
- Environment management is key to reproducible deployments

### 3. Automation is Essential for Medical Deployments
- Manual deployment leads to configuration errors
- Health checks prevent deployment of broken systems
- Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

### 4. Documentation is Critical for Medical Systems
- Complete deployment guides are necessary
- Compliance documentation must be maintained
- Architecture decisions must be documented

## Future Evolution Patterns

### 1. Kubernetes Migration
- Service definitions can be easily converted
- Health checks translate directly to Kubernetes probes
- Configuration management becomes more sophisticated

### 2. CI/CD Integration
- Automated testing can be integrated into pipeline
- Deployment scripts can be automated
- Health monitoring can be integrated with DevOps tools

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- Prometheus integration for metrics
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Alert management integration

This pattern represents a complete, production-ready approach to containerizing medical web applications with full regulatory compliance.
