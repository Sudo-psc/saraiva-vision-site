# VPS Deployment Optimization Session - 2025-09-24

## Session Overview
Complete migration of Saraiva Vision from Vercel to VPS deployment architecture. Successfully removed all Vercel dependencies and created comprehensive VPS deployment infrastructure.

## Key Technical Accomplishments

### Vercel Removal
- Removed `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/edge-config` dependencies
- Deleted `vercel.json` configuration file
- Eliminated Vercel-specific deployment scripts
- Updated package.json with VPS-focused commands

### VPS Infrastructure Created
- Created `deploy-vps.sh` for frontend deployment
- Created `deploy-prod.sh` for production deployment automation
- Added SSH configuration for VPS (31.97.129.78)
- Implemented backup and health check systems

### Environment Configuration
- Added Google Business API credentials configuration
- Configured Resend email service integration
- Set up Google Maps and Places API keys
- Created secure environment templates

### Build System Fixes
- Fixed ES module compatibility in `scripts/vps-setup.js`
- Converted CommonJS require() to ES module imports
- Updated Vite configuration for VPS deployment
- Disabled workbox plugin to avoid Qt display issues

### Security Improvements
- Removed OAuth tokens from git history
- Created template placeholders for sensitive data
- Implemented proper secret management practices
- Fixed GitHub secret protection blocking issues

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `VPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (352 lines)
- Documented complete deployment workflow and troubleshooting
- Added setup instructions and best practices

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **ES Module Error**: Fixed `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope` by converting to ES module syntax
2. **Vercel Integration Error**: Resolved "ERROR: Required file missing: vercel.json" by removing all Vercel dependencies
3. **Build Failures**: Fixed Qt display errors by disabling workbox plugin
4. **GitHub Security**: Resolved secret protection blocking by cleaning git history and removing sensitive data

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated dependencies and scripts
- `scripts/vps-setup.js` - Fixed ES module compatibility
- `deploy-prod.sh` - Complete rewrite for VPS deployment
- `deploy-vps.sh` - Updated for consistent paths
- `.env.production` - Added environment configuration
- `.env.docker` - Added Docker configuration
- `vite.config.js` - Fixed build configuration
- `VPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Created comprehensive documentation

## Branch Management
- Created branch: `vps-deployment-optimization`
- Successfully pushed to GitHub after security cleanup
- Commit hash: `57a524a`
- Ready for merge to main branch

## Current Status
✅ Complete - VPS deployment optimization finished
✅ All Vercel dependencies removed
✅ VPS deployment infrastructure created
✅ Security issues resolved
✅ Documentation complete
✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub

## Next Steps for Future Sessions
- Merge `vps-deployment-optimization` branch to main
- Test VPS deployment scripts on actual server
- Set up Docker containerization for backend services
- Configure Nginx reverse proxy
- Set up SSL certificates and HTTPS
- Implement monitoring and logging systems

## Lessons Learned
- Always check for ES module compatibility when writing Node.js scripts
- Never commit API keys or OAuth tokens to git history
- Create comprehensive deployment documentation before migrating
- Test deployment scripts in development environment first
- Use template placeholders for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper backup strategies before production deployment
