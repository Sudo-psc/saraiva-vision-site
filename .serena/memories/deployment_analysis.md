# Vercel Deployment Analysis

## Current Status
✅ **GOOD NEWS**: This project is already well-configured for Vercel deployment!

## Issues Found & Solutions

### 1. Missing SPA Fallback for React Router ❌
**Problem**: The current vercel.json lacks rewrites for SPA routing, which will cause 404 errors on deep links (like `/servicos`, `/sobre`, etc.).

**Impact**: Users accessing URLs directly (not from homepage) will get 404 errors.

**Solution Required**: Add rewrites to vercel.json for SPA fallback.

### 2. Modern Runtime Already Applied ✅
**Status**: Already using `@vercel/node` (modern runtime)
**Previous**: Was using `@vercel/node@16.x` (legacy)

### 3. Build Scripts Already Standardized ✅
**Status**: Perfect Vite build configuration
- `build`: "vite build"
- `build:vercel`: "vite build" 
- `outputDirectory`: "dist"

### 4. Environment Variables Already Correct ✅
**Status**: All variables use VITE_ prefix
- `VITE_API_URL`
- `VITE_WORDPRESS_URL`

## Recommended Actions

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Add SPA rewrites** to vercel.json for React Router support
2. **Test deployment** after adding rewrites

### ALREADY COMPLIANT
- ✅ Build commands are correct
- ✅ Output directory is correct
- ✅ Modern runtime is used
- ✅ Environment variables have VITE_ prefix
- ✅ Framework detection will work
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment scripts exist

## Deployment Readiness: 90%
Only missing SPA fallback configuration for React Router deep links.
