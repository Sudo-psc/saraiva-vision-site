# Task Completion Guide - Saraiva Vision Site

## Quality Checks Before Task Completion

### 1. Build Verification ✅ REQUIRED
```bash
npm run build
```
**What it checks**: Vite build process, TypeScript compilation, asset optimization
**Must pass**: No build errors or warnings

### 2. No Linting/Testing Commands
This project does not have configured:
- ESLint or other linting tools
- Jest, Vitest, or other testing frameworks
- Prettier or code formatting tools

### 3. Git Status Check
```bash
git status
```
Ensure all intended changes are staged and committed.

### 4. Deployment Validation (if applicable)
For deployment-related tasks:
```bash
# Quick deployment health check
node scripts/vercel-health-check.js quick

# Or full health check
node scripts/vercel-health-check.js full
```

### 5. Vercel-Specific Checks
If modifying Vercel configuration:
```bash
# Test configuration
npm run deploy:config test <config-name>

# Verify build with Vercel settings
npm run build:vercel
```

## Task Categories

### Code Changes
1. Run `npm run build` to verify build works
2. Check git status and commit changes
3. No additional linting/testing required

### Configuration Changes
1. Run `npm run build` to verify configuration
2. Test deployment configuration if applicable
3. Run health checks if modifying deployment

### Dependency Changes
1. Run `npm install` to update package-lock.json
2. Run `npm run build` to verify dependencies work
3. Test affected functionality manually

### Deployment Tasks
1. Run health check first
2. Use appropriate deployment command
3. Monitor deployment in Vercel dashboard
4. Verify deployed site functionality

## Success Criteria
- ✅ `npm run build` passes without errors
- ✅ No unintended changes in git status
- ✅ Deployed site (if applicable) loads correctly
- ✅ No console errors in browser
- ✅ All intended functionality works as expected

## No Automated Testing
This project relies on manual testing and build verification rather than automated test suites.
