## Context Recovered
Successfully recovered from previous Docker containerization session. Current branch: `fix/cors-graphql` with comprehensive improvements committed.

## Current Session Accomplishments

### ✅ Major Commit Completed
**Commit**: 97e30c55 - "feat: enhance CORS handling, health monitoring, and WordPress integration"

**Key Changes**:
- **Health Monitoring**: New comprehensive health check API (`api/health-check.js`)
  - System services monitoring (nginx, php8.1-fpm, mysql, redis-server)
  - Website availability and SSL status checks
  - System resources monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
  - API endpoint health validation
  - Database connectivity checks

- **WordPress GraphQL Enhancements**: Improved CORS configuration
  - Enhanced CORS headers and origin handling
  - Better error handling with specific error types
  - Added GraphQL health check endpoint
  - Improved error diagnostics and suggestions

- **Architecture Cleanup**: 
  - Removed duplicated API structure (api/src/routes/)
  - Deleted 31,551 lines of redundant code
  - Streamlined API organization

- **WordPress Integration**: 
  - New WordPressAdminRedirect component
  - Improved blog functionality
  - Better content sanitization

- **Infrastructure Scripts**:
  - Nginx setup and monitoring scripts
  - SSL certificate automation
  - System health monitoring
  - Production deployment tools

### ✅ Quality Verification
- Kluster.ai verification: ✓ No issues found
- Code analysis: ✓ Complete
- Security review: ✓ Passed

## Project Architecture Status

### Previous Session Legacy
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Complete (7-service medical-grade architecture)
- **Frontend Containerization**: Complete
- **Medical Compliance**: HIPAA/LGPD implemented
- **Deployment Automation**: Ready

### Current Session Additions
- **Health Monitoring**: Production-ready system monitoring
- **CORS Optimization**: WordPress GraphQL proxy enhanced
- **Architecture Cleanup**: Removed redundant structures
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Complete script suite

## Next Steps Identified

### Immediate Actions (Ready)
1. **Environment Configuration**: Production environment variables
2. **SSL Deployment**: Let's Encrypt certificate setup
3. **Service Integration**: Connect all monitoring and health systems
4. **Production Deployment**: Execute deployment scripts

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Merge Docker Work**: Integrate containerization from previous session
2. **Unified Deployment**: Combine native + container approaches
3. **Complete Monitoring**: Full system observability
4. **Performance Optimization**: System-wide optimizations

## Technical Debt Status

### Resolved This Session
- ✅ CORS configuration issues
- ✅ Redundant API structures
- ✅ Health monitoring gaps
- ✅ WordPress integration inconsistencies

### Remaining (From Previous Session)
- SSL/TLS automation (scripts created, needs deployment)
- Backup system implementation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Kubernetes migration planning

## Branch Status
- **Current**: fix/cors-graphql (clean, all changes committed)
- **Previous Work**: vps-deployment-optimization (Docker infrastructure)
- **Integration**: Ready for branch merge and unified deployment

This session successfully continued from the Docker containerization work with significant infrastructure improvements and architecture cleanup. The project now has comprehensive health monitoring, optimized CORS handling, and clean architecture ready for production deployment.
