## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** patient visiting the Saraiva Vision website,
**I want to** schedule, cancel, and reschedule appointments online while registering my personal information,
**So that** I can manage my healthcare consultations without needing to call the clinic or visit in person.

**As a** clinic administrator,
**I want** patient registrations and all appointment changes from the website to sync with our Ninsa√∫de system,
**So that** our staff can manage all appointments in one centralized platform.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: New Patient Appointment Booking**
1. **Given** a visitor on the website without an existing patient record
2. **When** they provide personal information (name, CPF, phone, email) and select an available appointment slot
3. **Then** the system creates a patient record in Ninsa√∫de AND confirms the appointment booking

**Scenario 2: Existing Patient Appointment Booking**
1. **Given** a patient who already exists in the Ninsa√∫de system
2. **When** they enter their CPF in the booking form
3. **Then** the system automatically retrieves their existing data, displays their name for confirmation, and allows direct access to appointment slot selection without re-entering personal information

**Scenario 3: View Available Appointment Slots**
1. **Given** a patient selecting a specialty/professional
2. **When** they choose a preferred date range
3. **Then** the system displays all available time slots from Ninsa√∫de for that professional

**Scenario 4: Appointment Confirmation**
1. **Given** a successfully booked appointment
2. **When** the booking is confirmed
3. **Then** the patient receives confirmation via email AND WhatsApp AND the appointment appears in the Ninsa√∫de dashboard

**Scenario 5: Appointment Cancellation**
1. **Given** a patient with an upcoming confirmed appointment
2. **When** they access their appointments list and select "cancel"
3. **Then** the system cancels the appointment in Ninsa√∫de AND notifies the patient of successful cancellation

**Scenario 6: Appointment Rescheduling**
1. **Given** a patient with an upcoming confirmed appointment
2. **When** they select "reschedule" and choose a new available time slot
3. **Then** the system updates the appointment in Ninsa√∫de with the new date/time AND confirms the change to the patient

**Scenario 7: Slot Availability Conflict**
1. **Given** a patient has selected a time slot and is completing the booking form
2. **When** another patient books the same slot before confirmation
3. **Then** the system displays an error message indicating the slot is no longer available AND allows the patient to select a different slot without re-entering their information

**Scenario 8: API Unavailability - Hybrid Fallback**
1. **Given** the Ninsa√∫de API is temporarily unavailable
2. **When** a patient attempts to book an appointment
3. **Then** the system queues the request with automatic retry AND if retries fail, displays offline form for manual processing AND notifies patient that clinic will contact them

**Scenario 9: Existing Patient CPF Detection**
1. **Given** a returning patient enters their CPF in the booking form
2. **When** the system finds existing patient data in Ninsa√∫de
3. **Then** the system displays "Bem-vindo de volta, [Nome do Paciente]" AND skips registration fields AND proceeds directly to appointment selection

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** a selected time slot becomes unavailable during the booking process?
  - System displays clear error message indicating slot is no longer available and prompts patient to select a different time slot
- **What happens when** patient data validation fails (invalid CPF format, missing required fields)?
  - System displays clear error messages and prevents submission
- **What happens when** the Ninsa√∫de API is unavailable or returns an error?
  - System attempts to queue the request with automatic retry mechanism (exponential backoff)
  - If retry attempts fail after threshold, system displays offline form allowing patient to submit for manual processing
  - Patient receives notification that request will be processed manually and clinic will contact them for confirmation
- **How does the system handle** duplicate patient registrations (same CPF)?
  - System automatically retrieves existing patient data from Ninsa√∫de using CPF lookup
  - Patient name is displayed for identity confirmation before proceeding
  - Existing patients bypass registration form and proceed directly to appointment selection
- **What happens when** a patient tries to book multiple appointments simultaneously?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Allow multiple bookings, limit to one active booking, or configurable per specialty?]
- **What happens when** email or WhatsApp notification delivery fails after successful appointment booking?
  - Appointment remains confirmed in Ninsa√∫de, system logs notification failure, retry mechanism attempts redelivery
