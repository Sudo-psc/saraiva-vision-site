# Tasks: Fix Double Scroll in Testimonials Section on Homepage

**Input**: Fix double scroll issue in testimonials section that's blocking natural page scrolling
**Prerequisites**: Current homepage analysis, CSS scroll system review, component integration assessment

## Problem Analysis

1. User reports double scroll issue in testimonials section on homepage ✅
   → Homepage currently has CompactGoogleReviews, not Testimonials component
   → CSS scroll system in src/styles/scroll-fix-clean.css may cause conflicts
   → Services component has complex scroll handling that might interfere
2. Root causes identified:
   → Potential overflow conflicts in .homepage-section CSS rules
   → Horizontal scroll handlers may conflict with vertical page scroll
   → Component scroll event propagation issues
3. Solution approach:
   → CSS scroll system fixes first
   → Component scroll behavior audit
   → Integration testing and validation
4. Success criteria:
   → Natural page scrolling restored
   → No double scroll bars
   → Mobile scroll works properly

## Phase 3.1: Investigation & Analysis

### T001 [P] Audit homepage scroll behavior and identify conflicts
**Files**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Analyze current homepage structure and scroll behavior. Identify which sections might be causing double scroll issues. Check if testimonials section exists and how scroll events are handled.

### T002 [P] Analyze CSS scroll system for overflow conflicts
**Files**: `src/styles/scroll-fix-clean.css`
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Review CSS scroll rules that might cause double scroll bars. Focus on `.homepage-section`, `.horizontal-scroll`, and global overflow settings that could interfere with natural page scrolling.

### T003 [P] Check CompactGoogleReviews component for scroll issues
**Files**: `src/components/CompactGoogleReviews.jsx`
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Examine if CompactGoogleReviews has internal scroll handling that conflicts with page scroll. This component serves the testimonials role on homepage currently.

## Phase 3.2: Services Component Scroll Analysis

### T004 [P] Audit Services component scroll handling conflicts
**Files**: `src/components/Services.jsx`
**Dependencies**: T001 (homepage analysis)
**Description**: Review Services component's complex scroll event handling, horizontal scroll logic, and wheel event listeners. Identify if these interfere with natural page scrolling when used in homepage context.

### T005 [P] Check scroll event propagation in Services carousel
**Files**: `src/components/Services.jsx`
**Dependencies**: T004 (Services analysis)
**Description**: Examine how Services component's scroll events propagate to parent containers. Look for preventDefault calls, passive event listeners, and scroll containment issues that block page scroll.

### T006 [P] Analyze CSS overflow properties in homepage sections
**Files**: `src/index.css`, `src/App.css`
**Dependencies**: T002 (CSS system analysis)
**Description**: Review global CSS that affects homepage sections. Check for overflow hidden, scroll behavior, and transform properties that might create additional scroll contexts.

## Phase 3.3: CSS Scroll System Fixes

### T007 Fix overflow conflicts in homepage section CSS rules
**Files**: `src/styles/scroll-fix-clean.css`
**Dependencies**: T002, T006 (CSS analysis complete)
**Description**: Remove or modify CSS rules that create conflicting scroll contexts. Fix `.homepage-section` overflow properties, ensure `overflow: visible` allows natural scrolling, remove problematic `overflow-x: hidden` if it blocks scroll propagation.

### T008 Update horizontal scroll handlers to not interfere with page scroll
**Files**: `src/styles/scroll-fix-clean.css`
**Dependencies**: T007 (overflow conflicts fixed)
**Description**: Modify `.horizontal-scroll` class rules to only affect horizontal scrolling within carousels. Ensure `overscroll-behavior-y: auto` allows vertical page scroll propagation when horizontal scroll reaches limits.

### T009 [P] Fix Services component scroll event handling
**Files**: `src/components/Services.jsx`
**Dependencies**: T004, T005 (Services analysis complete)
**Description**: Modify Services component to not block page scroll. Remove or modify wheel event listeners that prevent default, ensure passive listeners, fix scroll containment issues.

### T010 [P] Fix CompactGoogleReviews scroll conflicts if any
**Files**: `src/components/CompactGoogleReviews.jsx`
**Dependencies**: T003 (CompactGoogleReviews analysis)
**Description**: Address any scroll handling in CompactGoogleReviews that interferes with page scroll. Remove scroll event preventDefault, fix overflow properties, ensure proper scroll propagation.

## Phase 3.4: Integration & Testing

### T011 Test scroll behavior fixes across different screen sizes
**Files**: Browser testing across homepage
**Dependencies**: T007, T008, T009, T010 (all fixes applied)
**Description**: Manually test homepage scrolling on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewport sizes. Verify natural page scrolling works, no double scroll bars appear, and carousel functionality is preserved.

### T012 [P] Validate touch scroll behavior on mobile devices
**Files**: Mobile browser testing
**Dependencies**: T011 (basic scroll testing)
**Description**: Test touch scrolling on actual mobile devices or browser dev tools mobile simulation. Ensure swipe gestures work for page scroll, carousel touch interactions don't block page scroll.

### T013 [P] Test scroll behavior in different browsers
**Files**: Cross-browser testing
**Dependencies**: T011 (basic scroll testing)
**Description**: Test scroll fixes in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Verify consistent behavior across browsers, no browser-specific scroll conflicts.

### T014 Add Testimonials component to homepage if needed
**Files**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
**Dependencies**: T001, T011, T012, T013 (analysis and testing complete)
**Description**: Based on investigation findings, add actual Testimonials component to homepage if that's what's missing. Ensure it has proper scroll behavior and doesn't create conflicts.

## Phase 3.5: Final Validation & Performance

### T015 [P] Run Lighthouse performance tests to ensure no regression
**Files**: Performance testing
**Dependencies**: T011, T012, T013, T014 (all fixes complete)
**Description**: Run Lighthouse performance audits on homepage to ensure scroll fixes don't negatively impact performance scores. Verify Core Web Vitals remain good.

### T016 [P] Validate accessibility of scroll behavior
**Files**: Accessibility testing
**Dependencies**: T011, T012, T013, T014 (all fixes complete)
**Description**: Test scroll behavior with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Ensure scroll fixes don't break accessibility features like smooth scroll to sections.

### T017 [P] Document scroll behavior fixes and prevention measures
**Files**: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or project documentation
**Dependencies**: T015, T016 (validation complete)
**Description**: Document what was causing the double scroll issue, how it was fixed, and measures to prevent similar issues in the future.
