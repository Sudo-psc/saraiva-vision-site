# WordPress External Integration Feature Specification

## Overview

Implement a new WordPress integration system that supports external WordPress installations deployed on separate servers, serving posts via headless REST API.

## User Stories

### As a content administrator,
I want to manage WordPress content on an external server so that I can leverage existing WordPress installations without migration.

### As a developer,
I want to consume WordPress content from external servers via REST API so that I can integrate multiple WordPress sources seamlessly.

### As a site visitor,
I want to access WordPress content quickly and reliably so that I have a good user experience regardless of content source.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. External WordPress Integration
- Support multiple external WordPress installations
- Configure external WordPress sources via admin interface
- Automatic content synchronization from external sources
- Support for custom post types and taxonomies

### 2. REST API Consumption
- Headless content retrieval via WordPress REST API
- Authentication support for private content
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Error handling for service unavailability

### 3. Content Caching
- Local caching of external content for performance
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Fallback to live content when cache expires
- Cache warming for critical content

### 4. Proxy Layer
- API proxy endpoints to avoid CORS issues
- Request/response transformation capabilities
- Security middleware for external requests
- Monitoring and logging for proxy operations

### 5. Administration Interface
- Dashboard for managing external WordPress sources
- Health monitoring for external services
- Content synchronization status
- Error logs and diagnostics

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Content load time under 2 seconds
- Cache hit rate > 90%
- Support for 100+ concurrent requests
- Background synchronization without impacting frontend

### Security
- API key authentication for external services
- Request signing for sensitive operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all external API calls

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for external content
- Graceful degradation when external services down
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance

### Scalability
- Support for multiple external WordPress instances
- Horizontal scaling for proxy layer
- Database optimization for content storage
- CDN integration for static assets

## Technical Constraints

### WordPress REST API Compatibility
- Support WordPress REST API v2
- Compatible with WordPress 5.0+
- Handle custom endpoints and post types
- Support authentication via Application Passwords

### External Server Requirements
- WordPress must be accessible via HTTPS
- REST API must be enabled and accessible
- CORS headers must be properly configured
- Server must support modern PHP versions

### Database Considerations
- Separate table for external content metadata
- Indexing for efficient content retrieval
- Data archiving strategies
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Success Criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
1. External WordPress content displays correctly on the site
2. Content loads within 2 seconds from cache
3. Site remains functional when external WordPress is offline
4. Administrator can configure multiple external sources
5. All content passes security validation
6. System handles 100+ concurrent users without degradation
7. Content synchronization happens automatically in background

### Performance Metrics
- API response time < 500ms
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Cache hit rate > 90%
- Error rate < 0.1%

### Compliance Requirements
- All medical content includes CFM compliance information
- Patient data handling complies with LGPD
- Audit logs maintained for all external API calls
- Regular security assessments completed

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- WordPress REST API v2
- External WordPress installation(s)
- SSL certificates for external servers
- Monitoring and logging services

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Supabase database
- Current Node.js API structure
- Existing authentication system
- Current caching infrastructure (Redis)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **External Service Availability**: Implement caching and fallback mechanisms
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling and queuing
- **Data Consistency**: Implement validation and reconciliation processes
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implement comprehensive security validation

### Business Risks
- **Content Freshness**: Implement cache invalidation strategies
- **User Experience**: Design loading states and error handling
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Automate monitoring and alerting
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start
