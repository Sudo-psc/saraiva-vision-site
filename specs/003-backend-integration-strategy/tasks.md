- **Task 2.6.1 (WhatsApp Client)** is a prerequisite for **Task 2.6.2 (Chatbot)**.
- **Phase 3 (Testing & Deployment)** depends on the completion of all Phase 2 tasks.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Spotify API Rate Limits**: Implement robust caching and exponential backoff for sync jobs.
- **Email Deliverability**: Use dedicated IP sending with Resend, monitor spam scores, and set up DKIM/SPF.
- **WhatsApp API Approval**: Start application process early, ensure compliance with WhatsApp Business Policy.
- **Database Migration**: Plan carefully, create rollback scripts, and test migrations extensively on staging.
- **VPS Integration**: Use API gateways or service meshes to manage communication between Vercel and VPS services securely.

## Success Metrics

- **Technical**: All tests passing, API documentation complete, deployment successful, performance benchmarks met.
- **Business**: Content management workflow improved, podcast content auto-updated, contact form functional and reliable, dashboard provides actionable insights.
