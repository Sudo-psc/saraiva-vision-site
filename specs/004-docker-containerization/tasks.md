# Tasks: Docker Containerization Deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-docker-containerization/`
**Current State**: Partial containerization exists (frontend, API Dockerfiles; compose configs; missing WordPress, Nginx containers)
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: 4 containers (frontend, api, wordpress, nginx), Docker Compose, security hardening
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Container entities, volumes, networks
   → contracts/: Health check contracts, Dockerfile contracts, compose contracts
   → research.md: Technical decisions and best practices
   → quickstart.md: Validation scenarios and deployment workflows
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Missing Dockerfiles, environment configuration, security validation
   → Tests: Health checks, integration tests, E2E workflows
   → Core: Complete WordPress container, Nginx container, SSL integration
   → Integration: Service communication, volume mounting, networking
   → Polish: Performance optimization, monitoring, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All containers have Dockerfiles?
   → All services have health checks?
   → All integration scenarios covered?
```

## Notes

### TDD Enforcement
- All health check tests (T005-T008) MUST be written and MUST FAIL before implementing missing Dockerfiles (T013-T014)
- All integration tests (T009-T012) MUST be written and MUST FAIL before implementing service communication (T027-T030)
- Verify tests fail before implementing functionality
- Commit after each task completion

### Current State Considerations
- Frontend and API Dockerfiles already exist but need contract compliance validation
- Docker Compose configurations exist but need WordPress and Nginx service integration
- Focus on completing missing containers and validating existing implementations
- [P] tasks operate on different containers or independent configuration files
- Docker Compose update tasks are sequential as they modify the same files
- Security hardening is integrated throughout, not added as afterthought
- Performance optimization comes after security to ensure optimal secure configuration

### File Path Specifications
- Dockerfile.* files in repository root (frontend, API exist; WordPress, Nginx missing)
- Docker Compose files in repository root (exist but need service additions)
- Container configuration in nginx-configs/, wordpress-local/, scripts/ directories
- Tests follow standard structure in tests/contract/, tests/integration/
- Documentation updates in existing files plus new Docker-specific guides
