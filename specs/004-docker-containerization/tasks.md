# Tasks: Complete Docker Containerization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-docker-containerization/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Node.js 18+, React 18, PHP 8.1+, Nginx 1.20+, Docker 20.10+
   → Structure: web app (4 containers: frontend, api, wordpress, nginx)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 4 container entities → Dockerfile tasks
   → contracts/: Health check contract → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract Docker best practices → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Docker files, environment configuration
   → Tests: health check contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: Dockerfiles, Docker Compose configurations
   → Integration: service communication, volume persistence
   → Polish: security hardening, performance optimization, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different containers = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same Docker Compose file = sequential (no [P])
   → Health check tests before Dockerfile implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All containers have health check tests?
   → All containers have Dockerfiles?
   → All services have integration tests?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes

### TDD Enforcement
- All health check tests (T005-T008) MUST be written and MUST FAIL before implementing Dockerfiles (T013-T016)
- All integration tests (T009-T012) MUST be written and MUST FAIL before implementing service communication (T027-T030)
- Verify tests fail before implementing functionality
- Commit after each task completion

### Container-Specific Considerations
- [P] tasks operate on different containers or independent configuration files
- Docker Compose tasks are sequential as they modify the same files
- Security hardening is integrated throughout, not added as afterthought
- Performance optimization comes after security to ensure optimal secure configuration

### File Path Specifications
- All Dockerfile.* files in repository root
- Docker Compose files in repository root
- Container configuration in nginx-configs/, scripts/ directories
- Tests follow standard structure in tests/contract/, tests/integration/
- Documentation updates in existing files plus new Docker-specific guides
