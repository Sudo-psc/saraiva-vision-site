# Feature Specification: VPS Migration with Docker Containers

## Overview
Complete migration of Saraiva Vision website from current Vercel-based deployment to VPS hosting with Docker containers, Nginx configuration, and WordPress API integration.

## User Stories

### As a clinic administrator, I want to:
- Migrate the entire website to a VPS for better control and cost management
- Use Docker containers for consistent deployment and scalability
- Integrate WordPress API for content management capabilities
- Maintain all current functionality during the migration
- Have zero downtime during the transition period

### As a developer, I want to:
- Containerize the React frontend application
- Set up Nginx as reverse proxy and load balancer
- Configure WordPress headless CMS for content management
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline for container deployments
- Ensure high availability and disaster recovery

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Docker Containerization
- Frontend: React/Vite application containerized
- Backend: Node.js API services containerized
- Database: MySQL database containerized
- WordPress: WordPress with PHP-FPM containerized
- Nginx: Reverse proxy and static file serving containerized

### 2. VPS Infrastructure
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt) for HTTPS
- Firewall configuration (UFW)
- Monitoring and logging setup

### 3. Nginx Configuration
- Reverse proxy for all services
- SSL termination and HTTPS redirection
- Load balancing for multiple containers
- Static file caching and optimization
- Security headers and CORS configuration
- WordPress integration routing

### 4. WordPress Integration
- Headless WordPress setup for content management
- REST API integration with React frontend
- Custom post types for clinic services, doctors, blog posts
- Media library management
- User authentication and authorization

### 5. Database Migration
- Migrate existing Supabase data to MySQL
- Database schema optimization for WordPress
- Data integrity verification
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Server response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime availability
- Automatic scaling capabilities

### Security
- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- Regular security updates and patches
- Container security scanning
- Database encryption at rest
- DDoS protection and rate limiting

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for frontend containers
- Database connection pooling
- Content delivery network (CDN) integration
- Load balancing for high traffic periods

### Maintainability
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Docker Compose
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Technical Constraints

### Infrastructure
- VPS provider: Current hosting provider (31.97.129.78)
- Minimum 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 80GB storage
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS required
- Docker version 20.10+
- Docker Compose version 2.0+

### Application
- React 18, TypeScript, Vite frontend
- Node.js 22+ runtime
- MySQL 8.0 database
- WordPress 6.0+ with REST API
- Nginx 1.20+

### Integration
- Preserve existing Supabase data during migration
- Maintain current API endpoint structure
- Keep existing UI/UX design
- Ensure all third-party integrations continue working

## Success Criteria

### Migration Success
- [ ] All website pages functional on new VPS
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Performance metrics meet or exceed current deployment
- [ ] SSL certificates properly configured
- [ ] WordPress API successfully integrated

### Technical Success
- [ ] Docker containers running successfully
- [ ] Nginx configuration working correctly
- [ ] Database migration completed with integrity
- [ ] Monitoring and logging operational
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

### Operational Success
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Deployment automation working
- [ ] Team trained on new infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] Maintenance procedures established

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- VPS server provisioned with Ubuntu 22.04
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic network configuration completed
- Security hardening implemented

### Phase 2: Containerization
- Frontend React app containerized
- Backend services containerized
- WordPress container configured
- Nginx reverse proxy setup

### Phase 3: Data Migration
- Supabase data exported
- MySQL database configured
- Data imported and verified
- WordPress content structure created

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- WordPress API integration working
- All frontend functionality preserved
- Performance testing completed
- Security testing passed

### Phase 5: Deployment
- DNS records updated
- SSL certificates installed
- Production environment verified
- Monitoring systems operational

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Domain name registration and DNS management
- SSL certificate provider (Let's Encrypt)
- Third-party API services (Google Maps, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Payment processing services (if applicable)

### Internal Dependencies
- Current database schema and data
- Existing API endpoints and contracts
- Current authentication system
- Existing UI components and design system

## Risks and Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Data loss during migration**: Implement comprehensive backup strategy
- **Downtime during transition**: Use blue-green deployment approach
- **Performance degradation**: Load testing and optimization before cutover

### Medium Risk
- **WordPress integration complexity**: Thorough testing of API endpoints
- **Container security vulnerabilities**: Regular scanning and updates
- **Configuration errors**: Staging environment testing

### Low Risk
- **Team learning curve**: Training and documentation
- **Cost overruns**: Resource monitoring and optimization
