# Feature Specification: Resend Email Integration for Contact Form

## Overview
Integrate the existing contact form with Resend API to send structured patient contact requests directly to Dr. Philipe's email (philipe_cruz@outlook.com). This replaces the current form submission system with a reliable, medical-grade email delivery service.

## User Stories

**I want to** submit a contact form with my medical inquiry  
**So that** Dr. Philipe receives my information and can respond appropriately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Form validates patient information (name, email, phone, message)
- Email is sent immediately upon successful submission
- Patient receives confirmation of successful submission
- Form handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- LGPD privacy consent is required before submission

### US2: Doctor Email Reception
**As a** Dr. Philipe (medical professional)  
**I want to** receive structured patient inquiries via email  
**So that** I can review and respond to potential patients efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Email contains all patient information in professional format
- Subject line clearly identifies it as a website contact request

- Patient contact details are easily accessible for response

### US3: System Reliability
**As a** clinic administrator  
**I want to** ensure all patient contact requests are delivered  
**So that** no potential patients are lost due to technical issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Email delivery has 99.9%+ reliability through Resend
- System handles API failures with proper error logging
