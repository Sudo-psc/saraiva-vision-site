# Feature Specification: Resend Email Integration for Contact Form

## Overview
Integrate the existing contact form with Resend API to send structured patient contact requests directly to Dr. Philipe's email (philipe_cruz@outlook.com). This replaces the current form submission system with a reliable, medical-grade email delivery service deployed on Vercel.
