## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new patient, I want to register and schedule my first medical appointment through the Saraiva Vision website using the Ninsaude system, so I can complete full patient registration and book available time slots without calling the clinic.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new patient on the Saraiva Vision website, **When** I want to schedule an appointment, **Then** I must complete full patient registration and be able to view available time slots and book an appointment
2. **Given** I have selected a time slot, **When** I provide my complete registration information and contact details, **Then** the appointment should be confirmed only after successful validation and booking in the Ninsaude system, with confirmation displayed in both systems
3. **Given** I need to reschedule an appointment, **When** I request to change the time, **Then** the system should check availability and update the appointment in both systems
4. **Given** I need to cancel an appointment, **When** I request cancellation, **Then** the appointment slot should be freed up in both systems

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no appointments are available within the 90-day booking window?
- How does system handle duplicate appointment attempts?
- What happens when Ninsaude API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle appointment conflicts or overlapping bookings?

## Clarifications *(mandatory if NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers exist)*

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: Appointment Booking Scope ‚Üí A: New patient self-service booking (full patient registration)
- Q: Appointment Time Horizon ‚Üí D: Up to 90 days in advance
- Q: Real-time Synchronization ‚Üí A: Immediate sync required (appointment confirmed only after Ninsaude confirms)
- Q: Patient Data Requirements ‚Üí A: Basic info only (name, phone, email, CPF)

### Session 1: API Integration Details
- **Ninsaude API Endpoints**: Need to identify specific endpoints for appointment booking, cancellation, and rescheduling
- **Authentication Method**: Need to determine API authentication (OAuth, API keys, tokens)
- **Data Format**: Need to understand required data structure for appointment requests
- **Error Handling**: Need to define how to handle API errors and failures

### Session 2: Business Logic
- **Appointment Duration**: Need to define standard appointment durations by service type
- **Cancellation Policy**: Need to specify cancellation windows and policies
- **Notification Preferences**: Need to clarify patient notification methods (email, SMS, both)
- **Data Retention**: Need to specify how long appointment data should be retained
