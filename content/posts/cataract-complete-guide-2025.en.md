Introduction
------------
Cataract is the opacification of the crystalline lens — the natural lens inside the eye — which leads to blurred vision and progressive loss of sharpness. It is common with aging and has an effective treatment: cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. This guide brings, in a clear and direct way, the main information to help you decide the best time to treat.

What is a cataract?
-------------------
In a healthy eye, the crystalline lens is transparent and focuses light onto the retina. With cataract, the lens becomes opaque, reducing the amount of light that reaches the retina and decreasing visual quality. Progression is usually slow and varies from person to person.

Common symptoms
---------------
- Blurry or “foggy” vision
- Reduced contrast sensitivity and colors that look “washed out”
- Glare and halos with lights (night driving, sunlight)
- Need for more light to read
- Frequent changes in eyeglass prescription
- Difficulty driving at night

Main causes and types
---------------------
- Aging (senile): the most frequent cause
- Secondary: long‑term corticosteroid use, ocular trauma, inflammation
- Congenital/pediatric: present at birth or in childhood
- Metabolic: associated with conditions like diabetes

When to seek evaluation?
------------------------
See your ophthalmologist if you notice worsening vision for daily activities (reading, driving, working) or excessive light sensitivity. Diagnosis is clinical, with slit‑lamp exam, and may include retinal evaluation and biometry for IOL calculation.

Treatment: is there a collyrium for cataract?
---------------------------------------------
No eyedrops or medications can “dissolve” a cataract. The effective treatment is surgical. Indication depends on the impact on your quality of life and medical evaluation.

Cataract surgery (phacoemulsification)
--------------------------------------
- Outpatient procedure with local anesthesia and mild sedation
- Micro‑incisions (usually 2–3 mm), often sutureless
- Cataract removal by ultrasound (phacoemulsification) and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation
- Average duration: 10–20 minutes per eye, depending on the case

Intraocular lenses (IOL): which one to choose?
----------------------------------------------
The IOL replaces the crystalline lens and can reduce dependence on glasses. The choice is individualized, considering habits, occupation, and exam results.

- Monofocal: usually focused for distance; glasses are often needed for near
- Monovision with monofocal IOLs: one eye for distance, the other for near (requires prior testing)
- Toric: corrects significant astigmatism (can be combined with monofocal or premium IOLs)
- EDOF (extended depth of focus): good distance and intermediate vision, with fewer night halos
- Multifocal/trifocal: greater independence from glasses for distance, intermediate and near; may cause halos and glare at night in some cases

How do we decide the ideal IOL?
-------------------------------
Based on biometry (IOL calculation), topography/astigmatism, ocular dominance, reading preferences and nighttime driving. The decision is shared: doctor and patient align expectations, benefits and potential visual phenomena.

Post‑operative care and recovery
-------------------------------
- Antibiotic and anti‑inflammatory eyedrops as prescribed
- Eye shield to sleep during the first days
- Avoid rubbing the eyes and exposure to dust/direct water in the first weeks
- Resume light activities within 24–48h; sports and swimming only after medical clearance
- Visual recovery often starts in the first days, with stabilization over a few weeks

Risks and possible complications (uncommon)
-------------------------------------------
- Intraocular inflammation and transient intraocular pressure rise
- Posterior capsule opacification (may require YAG‑laser in the future)
- Cystoid macular edema (rare)
- Intraocular infection (endophthalmitis — very rare but severe)

Myths and facts
---------------
- “Does cataract come back?” — Once treated, cataract does not “come back”. Posterior capsule opacification can occur and is treatable in office with YAG‑laser.
- “Do I need to wait for it to ‘mature’?” — No. The ideal time is when cataract interferes with your quality of life and exams show safety for surgery.
- “Is surgery painful?” — Generally not. Local anesthesia and mild sedation are used.

FAQ
---
1) When to operate?  
When cataract limits your activities or when there is risk to the retina/eye, according to medical evaluation.

2) Can both eyes be operated on the same day?  
In selected cases, yes. The decision is individualized according to protocol and safety.

3) How long away from work?  
Most people resume light activities in 1–3 days. Sports, dust and direct water in the eyes require more time.

4) Will I need glasses afterwards?  
It depends on the IOL choice and your astigmatism. Monofocals usually require glasses for near; premium IOLs can reduce the need.

5) I have diabetes. Can I undergo surgery?  
Yes, but good glycemic control and retinal evaluation are essential before surgery.

When to schedule an appointment
-------------------------------
If you’ve noticed worsening vision, difficulty driving, reading or working, a specialized evaluation helps define the best time to operate and the most suitable IOL for your case.
