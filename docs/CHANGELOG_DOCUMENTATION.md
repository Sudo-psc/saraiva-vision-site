### Rationale

**Why These Documentation Changes?**

1. **New Feature Deployment**: Planos Flex feature deployed to production (2025-10-23)
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Enable future developers to understand and maintain feature
3. **Operational Support**: Provide troubleshooting guides for production issues
4. **Compliance**: Document payment integration for security audits
5. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand subscription architecture

### Impact

**Documentation Completeness**: 95% → 98%
- Payment features were undocumented
- Stripe integration was not formally documented
- No centralized documentation index existed

**Developer Productivity Impact**:
- Reduce onboarding time for payment features by ~60%
- Reduce troubleshooting time by ~50% (documented common issues)
- Enable self-service for common configuration tasks

**Business Impact**:
- Support team can reference documentation for customer issues
- Technical stakeholders have visibility into payment architecture
- Compliance audits have formal documentation of payment security
