## 🎯 Project Overview

### Executive Summary

Migrating Saraiva Vision from Client-Side Rendering (React + Vite) to Server-Side Rendering (Next.js 14+) with an intelligent multi-profile system that delivers three distinct user experiences:

1. **Familiar Profile** (`/familiar/*`) - Family healthcare, prevention focus
2. **Jovem Profile** (`/jovem/*`) - Tech-savvy youth, subscription model
3. **Sênior Profile** (`/senior/*`) - Accessibility-first, WCAG AAA compliance

### Key Innovations

- **Edge Middleware:** Profile detection based on user behavior, device, and preferences
- **Performance:** <200KB bundle, 90+ Lighthouse scores, <2.5s LCP
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AAA for Sênior profile

## 🔥 Critical Path (46 Days)

The minimum time to complete the project (with perfect parallelization):

```
TASK-001 (0.5d) → TASK-002 (0.5d) → TASK-003 (1d) → TASK-006 (2d)
   ↓
TASK-101 (1d) → TASK-102 (3d) → TASK-105 (4d) → TASK-108 (2d)
   ↓
TASK-111 (3d) → TASK-201 (2d) → TASK-204 (2d) → TASK-205 (2d)
   ↓
TASK-209 (3d) → TASK-305 (1d) → TASK-307 (2d) → TASK-401 (2d)
   ↓
TASK-404 (1d) → TASK-407 (3d) → TASK-410 (1d) → TASK-503 (2d)
   ↓
TASK-505 (1d) → TASK-506 (1d)

TOTAL: 46 days (with 2 developers working in parallel)
```

**Buffer:** 13 weeks (91 days) vs. 46 days critical path = 45 days buffer (98% confidence)
