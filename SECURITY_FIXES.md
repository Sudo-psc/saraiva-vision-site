# üîí Critical Security Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. API Key Exposure (CRITICAL) - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: `.env` file with sensitive credentials was at risk of being committed
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent any environment file commits
  - Updated `.env.example` with security guidelines and examples
  - Added comprehensive comments and security checklist

### 2. Hardcoded Supabase Credentials (CRITICAL) - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Supabase URL and key hardcoded in `src/lib/customSupabaseClient.js`
- **Solution**:
  - Moved credentials to environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
  - Added validation to ensure environment variables are present
  - Added descriptive error messages for missing configuration

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Improvements Made

### Enhanced .gitignore
- Comprehensive coverage of all sensitive file patterns
- Multiple environment file variations protected
- Clear commenting for critical security sections

### Environment Variable Security
- All sensitive data now uses environment variables
- Validation ensures proper configuration
- Clear documentation in `.env.example`

### Configuration Validation
- Runtime checks for missing environment variables
- Descriptive error messages for developers
- Fail-fast approach for security misconfigurations

## üîç Verification

‚úÖ **Build Test Passed**: Application builds successfully with new environment variable configuration
‚úÖ **Git Security**: `.env` is properly ignored and not tracked
‚úÖ **Environment Template**: `.env.example` provides secure setup guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions (Within 24 hours):

1. **Regenerate API Keys** (If previously exposed):
   ```bash
   # Google Cloud Console:
   # 1. Disable the current API key
   # 2. Generate a new Google Maps API key
   # 3. Restrict new key to your domains only
   # 4. Update .env with new key
   ```

2. **Verify Supabase Security**:
   - Check Supabase dashboard for any unauthorized access
   - Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled
   - Review Supabase auth logs for anomalies

3. **Domain Restrictions** (Critical):
   ```
   Restrict Google API key to these domains:
   - https://saraivavision.com.br
   - https://www.saraivavision.com.br
   - http://localhost:3000 (development only)
   ```

### For Production Deployment:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in all required values
3. Verify API key restrictions are in place
4. Test all integrations (Maps, Supabase, etc.)

## üîê Security Checklist for Future Deployments

- [ ] `.env` file never committed to git
- [ ] All API keys restricted to specific domains
- [ ] Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) enabled
- [ ] Regular API key rotation (every 90 days)
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized API usage
- [ ] Review Supabase access logs monthly

## üìã Remaining Security Tasks

While the CRITICAL issues are fixed, consider addressing these for complete security:

1. **High Priority**: Update vulnerable dependencies (`npm audit fix --force`)
2. **High Priority**: Sanitize HTML content using DOMPurify
3. **Medium Priority**: Strengthen Content Security Policy
4. **Medium Priority**: Add missing security headers
