## 🚨 Current Issues & Warnings

### ⚠️ WARNINGS DETECTED

1. **High Nginx Error Rate**: 16 errors in last 100 log lines
   - **Root Cause**: Attempts to access `api.saraivavision.com.br` upstream on port 8000 (connection refused)
   - **Impact**: Non-critical - affects misconfigured subdomain routing only
   - **Recommendation**: Review and clean up Nginx configuration for unused API subdomain

2. **Suspicious Activity**: 22 suspicious requests in last 1000 access logs
   - **Pattern**: Automated scans targeting IoT vulnerabilities (cgi-bin, luci, shell, .php)
   - **Impact**: Low - all requests properly blocked and logged
   - **Status**: Normal web security background noise

## 🛡️ Security Assessment

### ✅ SECURE
- **Failed SSH Attempts**: 0 today
- **SSL Certificate**: Valid for 86 days (expires Dec 27, 2025)
- **Firewall**: Configured and operational
- **Access Control**: All suspicious requests properly handled

### 📋 Recent Security Events
