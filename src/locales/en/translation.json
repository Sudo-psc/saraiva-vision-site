      "lenses_cost": {
        "question": "How much does contact lens fitting cost in Caratinga?",
        "answer": "The cost of contact lens fitting in Caratinga varies according to the type of lens (soft, rigid or special for keratoconus), case complexity and included exams. At Saraiva Vision, the process involves ophthalmological consultation, fitting tests and initial follow-up to ensure comfort and clear vision. The cost is affordable and proportional to the safety offered, as proper fitting prevents complications like infections or eye discomfort. Investing in adequate fitting ensures visual health and long-term well-being."
      },
      "pediatric_age": {
        "question": "What's the ideal age to take a child to an ophthalmologist?",
        "answer": "The first ophthalmological consultation should occur in the first year of life, around 6 months. Then, a new evaluation is recommended at 3 years and before literacy. In Caratinga, many parents seek Saraiva Vision to ensure their children don't have vision problems that could harm learning. Symptoms like getting too close to TV, frequently rubbing eyes or having difficulty seeing the blackboard are warning signs. Early detection prevents strabismus, amblyopia and refractive errors."
      },
      "medical_report": {
        "question": "How does the ophthalmological report exam work?",
        "answer": "The ophthalmological report exam in Caratinga performed by Saraiva Vision follows rigorous technical criteria. It includes visual acuity, ocular motility assessment, color vision test, tonometry and fundus examination when necessary. The report is issued the same day, with legal validity and medical signature (CRM), being accepted by agencies like DETRAN, public tenders and admission processes. This document provides legal and clinical safety, confirming the patient's visual fitness for professional or licensing activities."
      },
      "glaucoma_treatment": {
        "question": "How long does glaucoma treatment take?",
        "answer": "Glaucoma treatment is continuous, as there is no definitive cure. The goal is to control intraocular pressure and preserve the optic nerve, preventing vision loss. Follow-up time depends on disease stage and treatment response, which may include eye drops, laser or surgery. At Saraiva Vision, each patient receives an individualized protocol with periodic consultations and optic nerve monitoring. Success depends on discipline in medication use and regular medical follow-up throughout life."
      },
      "vision_symptoms": {
        "question": "What symptoms indicate vision problems?",
        "answer": "Main symptoms of vision problems include: blurred vision, eye pain, difficulty reading up close or seeing far, redness, light sensitivity and frequent headaches. In children, signs include poor school performance, constant stumbling and excessive screen proximity. At Saraiva Vision, complete exams can identify from myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism to more serious diseases like glaucoma and cataracts. Seeking early care is fundamental to preserve vision and ensure quality of life."
