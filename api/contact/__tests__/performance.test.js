/**
 * Performance Tests for Contact API
 * 
 * This file is intended for load and performance testing of the /api/contact endpoint.
 * These tests are designed to be run with tools like k6 or Artillery, not directly with vitest.
 * 
 * To run these tests:
 * 
 * Using k6:
 * 1. Install k6: https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/
 * 2. Save the k6 script below as `k6-contact-test.js`
 * 3. Run: k6 run k6-contact-test.js
 * 
 * Example k6 script (k6-contact-test.js):
 * 
 * import http from 'k6/http';
 * import { check, sleep } from 'k6';
 * 
 * export const options = {
 *   stages: [
 *     { duration: '30s', target: 10 },  // Ramp up to 10 users over 30 seconds
 *     { duration: '1m', target: 10 },   // Stay at 10 users for 1 minute
 *     { duration: '30s', target: 0 },   // Ramp down to 0 users
 *   ],
 *   thresholds: {
 *     http_req_duration: ['p(95)<2000'], // 95% of requests must complete below 2s
 *     http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],    // Less than 1% of requests can fail
 *   },
 * };
 * 
 * const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'; // Or your Vercel preview URL
 * 
 * export default function () {
 *   const payload = JSON.stringify({
 *     name: 'Performance Test User',
 *     email: 'test@example.com',
 *     phone: '+55 11 99999-9999',
 *     message: 'This is a performance test message.',
 *     consent: true,
 *     honeypot: ''
 *   });
 * 
 *   const params = {
 *     headers: {
 *       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
 *     },
 *   };
 * 
 *   const res = http.post(`${BASE_URL}/api/contact`, payload, params);
 * 
 *   check(res, {
 *     'status was 200': (r) => r.status == 200,
 *     'response time was < 3s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 3000,
 *     'response has success': (r) => JSON.parse(r.body).success === true,
 *   });
 * 
 *   sleep(1); // Wait 1 second between requests
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * Using Artillery:
 * 1. Install Artillery: npm install -g artillery
 * 2. Save the Artillery config below as `artillery-contact-test.yml`
 * 3. Run: artillery run artillery-contact-test.yml
 * 
 * Example Artillery config (artillery-contact-test.yml):
 * 
 * config:
 *   target: 'http://localhost:3000' # Or your Vercel preview URL
 *   phases:
 *     - duration: 60
 *       arrivalRate: 5
 *   http:
 *     timeout: 10
 *     extendedMetrics: true
 * 
 * scenarios:
 *   - name: 'Contact Form Submission'
 *     requests:
 *       - url: '/api/contact'
 *         method: POST
 *         headers:
 *           Content-Type: 'application/json'
 *         json:
 *           name: 'Artillery Test User'
 *           email: 'test@example.com'
 *           phone: '+55 11 99999-9999'
 *           message: 'This is a load test message.'
 *           consent: true
 *           honeypot: ''
 *         expect:
 *           - statusCode: 200
 *           - contentType: json
 *           - hasProperty: success
 * 
 * 
 * The following are placeholder vitest tests to ensure this file is considered in the test suite.
 * Actual performance testing should be done with the tools mentioned above.
