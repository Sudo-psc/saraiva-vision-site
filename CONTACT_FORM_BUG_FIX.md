# Contact Form Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Circular Structure JSON Error in AnalyticsFallback.jsx

**Problem**: When submitting the contact form, the analytics tracking was attempting to serialize data containing circular references, causing the error:
```
❌ GTM event "form_submit" error: TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
    --> starting at object with constructor 'HTMLInputElement'
```

**Root Cause**: The sanitization logic in `AnalyticsFallback.jsx` was not robust enough to handle:
- Nested objects with circular references
- React Fiber internal properties on DOM elements
- Arrays containing DOM elements

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a `deepSanitize` function using `WeakSet` to detect and prevent circular references
- Added comprehensive checks for DOM elements (`Element`, `Node`, `nodeType`, `jquery`)
- Recursively sanitize nested objects and arrays
- Filter out undefined values from sanitized data
- Added try-catch wrapper around `JSON.stringify` to gracefully handle any remaining edge cases

**Files Changed**:
- `src/components/AnalyticsFallback.jsx`

### 2. Auto-Executing Example Code in fetch-with-retry.js

**Problem**: The `scripts/fetch-with-retry.js` file contained example code at the bottom that auto-executed when the module was imported, causing:
```
fetch-with-retry.js:373 Failed: SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input
```

**Root Cause**: Lines 366-381 contained example code that:
1. Made a fetch request to `/api/analytics/ga` on module load
2. Called `response.json()` without checking if response had content
3. Failed when API returned 204 No Content or empty response

**Solution**: 
- Removed the auto-executing example code (lines 366-381)
- Kept only the export statement

**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/fetch-with-retry.js`

## Testing

Created comprehensive unit tests in `src/components/__tests__/AnalyticsFallback.test.jsx` to verify:
- Component renders without crashing
- Circular references are handled gracefully
- DOM elements are filtered out from analytics data
- JSON.stringify succeeds on sanitized data

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Form Submission**: Contact form should submit successfully without console errors
2. **Analytics Tracking**: Form submission events should be tracked via server-side fallback without circular reference errors
3. **No Auto-Execution**: No spurious fetch requests on page load
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when analytics endpoints return empty responses

## Additional Notes

- Service worker (sw.js) errors about Datadog are likely due to network issues or ad blockers and are non-critical
- Validation errors (`errorHandling.js:620 🚨 Error [validation]`) are expected when form validation fails and are working as designed
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing analytics tracking code
